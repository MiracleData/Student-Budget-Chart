# Student-Budget-Chart

This program serves as a valuable tool for students aiming to manage their monthly budget efficiently. It begins by prompting users to set their monthly spending goal. Following this, the program collects information on essential expenses like rent, utilities, transportation, and food. Additionally, it incorporates a fixed car payment of $325.75, treated as a variable in the calculations.

The output features a well-structured chart that itemizes each expense, including its respective amount and percentage of the total. Beneath the chart, key financial details are presented, such as the specified monthly goal, the total of all expenses, and the remaining budget. To maintain precision, all numerical values are rounded to two decimal places.

In terms of formatting, the chart employs field width alignment, ensuring a clean and visually appealing display with appropriate spacing. The user's name is seamlessly integrated into the chart's heading, providing a personalized touch. Adequate blank lines are strategically placed to enhance content separation.

For versatility, the program is designed to accommodate testing with various datasets. To facilitate the submission process, both the source code (.py) and a screenshot of the program's output are required.
